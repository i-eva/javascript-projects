    <h1>Why I Love Web Development</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Webs may be sticky but not as sticky as, say, Valentine's Day</li>
      <li>Developing black and white photography has gone away, what else to develop?</li>
      <li>I Love Lucy episodes are outdated and pretty much gone, so what else to love?</li>
    </ol>

      If I ruled the earth, I would develop wonderful webby webpages. My colors would be colorful. My landscapes would unfold amazing scenes before your wondering eyes.
