// Question: What is printed when this program  (lines 2-4) runs?
function sayHello() {
   console.log("Hello, World!");
}
// Answer: my guess is nothing, because the function is never called
// Nothing appered, so we'll try again and add a call line:

sayHello();

// This time, console.log was able to do it's thing
